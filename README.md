## 2 -- Interacting with APIs to import data from the web
learn the basics of extracting data from APIs, gain insight on the importance of APIs, and practice extracting data by diving into the OMDB and Library of Congress APIs.
## 3 -- Diving deep into the Twitter API
learn how to stream real-time Twitter data, and how to analyze and visualize it.
